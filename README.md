<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
<br>
<p>This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms in Python. By analyzing patient health metrics, it helps identify individuals at risk, enabling early intervention and better medical decision-making.</p>
<br>
<p>The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains 14 health-related features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., to help predict the risk of heart disease.</p>
